`Space Proximity Operation Tools (Spot)` is a CMake-based C++ library to support applications to simulate on-orbit proximity operations. `Spot` is being developed in the framework of the EU FP7 project [Stardust](http://www.stardust2013.eu).


Features
------

  - Complete unit test suite

Requirements
------

To install this project, please ensure that you have installed the following (install guides are provided on the respective websites):

  - [Git](http://git-scm.com)
  - A C++ compiler, e.g., [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/), [clang](http://clang.llvm.org/), [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/)
  - [CMake](http://www.cmake.org)
  - [Doxygen](http://www.doxygen.org "Doxygen homepage") (optional)
  - [Gcov](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Gcov.html) (optional)
  - [LCOV](http://ltp.sourceforge.net/coverage/lcov.php) (optional)

`Spot` is dependent upon the following libraries:

  - [CATCH](https://www.github.com/philsquared/Catch) (unit testing library necessary for `BUILD_TESTS` build option)

These dependencies will be downloaded and configured automagically if not already present locally (requires an internet connection).

Installation
------

Run the following commands to download, build, and install this project.

    git clone https://www.github.com/kartikkumar/spot
    cd spot
    git submodule init && git submodule update
    mkdir build && cd build
    cmake .. && cmake --build .

To install the header files, run the following from within the `build` directory:

    make install

Note that dependencies are installed by fetching them online, in case they cannot be detected on your local system. If the build process fails, check the error log given. Typically, building fails due to timeout. Simply run the `cmake --build .` command once more.

Build options
-------------

You can pass the following, general command-line options when running CMake:

  - `-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX[=$install_dir]`: set path prefix for install script (`make install`); if not set, defaults to usual locations
  - `-DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=[on|off (default)]`: build shared libraries instead of static
  - `-DBUILD_DOXYGEN_DOCS[=ON|OFF (default)]`: build the [Doxygen](http://www.doxygen.org "Doxygen homepage") documentation ([LaTeX](http://www.latex-project.org/) must be installed with `amsmath` package)
  - `-DBUILD_TESTS[=ON|OFF (default)]`: build tests (execute tests from build-directory using `ctest -V`)
  - `-DBUILD_DEPENDENCIES[=ON|OFF (default)]`: force local build of dependencies, instead of first searching system-wide using `find_package()`

The following command is conditional and can only be set if `BUILD_TESTS = ON`:

 - `-DBUILD_COVERAGE_ANALYSIS[=ON|OFF (default)]`: build code coverage using [Gcov](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Gcov.html) and [LCOV](http://ltp.sourceforge.net/coverage/lcov.php) (both must be installed; requires [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/) compiler; execute coverage analysis from build-directory using `make coverage`)

Pass these options either directly to the `cmake ..` build command or run `ccmake ..` instead to bring up the interface that can be used to toggle options.
